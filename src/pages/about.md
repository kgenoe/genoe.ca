Hey, I'm Kyle. I'm an iOS developer, working for Zoocasa Realty, in Toronto, Canada. I have Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of Guelph.

In my spare time I develop my own iOS apps, listen to podcasts, and pursue a bunch of random hobbies (this month is [knitting](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/kylegenoe)!).
