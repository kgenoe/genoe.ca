Mood is an emotional health tracking app. It allows a user to periodically input their current mental state (or mood) into the app, along with a note explaining the context around their mental state. Users can then see a log of all their previously entered moods, as well as trends in their mood past moods. Finally the user can opt-in to be notified periodically, either randomly or on a set schedule, to enter their mood. Mood was developed with the intention of eventually being connected with iOSâ€™s HealthKit framework. This would allow trends in emotional health to be linked to all the data collected by HealthKit including sleep analysis, daily activity, body weight, and more.
